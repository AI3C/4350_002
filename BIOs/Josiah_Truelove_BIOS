Strengths:
I have been loaded up on my experience with C# and websites, specifically MVC archictecture with SQL functionality, and HTML and CSS with limited bootstrap knowledge
I will say though that I like bootstrap and would love to work with it more
HTML & CSS is a weakpoint for me, not good at making stuff look pretty, but do understand how they work quite well.
Familiar with Scripting in BASH but am not an expert in it
Limited familiarity with SQL but understand the concepts quite well, also know how to set up database tables using ASP.NET MVC, let me be clear though I am not good
at writing scripts in SQL, but I will if I need to.
Familiar with Java but has been 2 years since I've coded it
Not familiar with Python, but have been introduced to it in classes
